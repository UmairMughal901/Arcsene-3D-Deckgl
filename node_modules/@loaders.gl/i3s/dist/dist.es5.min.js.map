A rendered (i.e. deck.gl `Tile3DLayer`) triggers `tileset.update()` after a `tileset` is loaded\n  `tileset` starts traversing the tile tree and update `requestTiles` (tiles of which content need\n  to be fetched) and `selectedTiles` (tiles ready for rendering under the current viewport).\n  `Tile3DLayer` will update rendering based on `selectedTiles`.\n  `Tile3DLayer` also listens to `onTileLoad` callback and trigger another round of `update and then traversal`\n  when new tiles are loaded.\n\n  As I3S tileset have stored `tileHeader` file (metadata) and tile content files (geometry, texture, ...) separately.\n  During each traversal, it issues `tilHeader` requests if that `tileHeader` is not yet fetched,\n  after the tile header is fulfilled, it will resume the traversal starting from the tile just fetched (not root).\n\n  Tile3DLayer\n       |\n   await load(tileset)\n       |\n   tileset.update()\n       |                async load tileHeader\n
